DNS lookup and reverse lookup returned nicely using the _host_ tool.

A reference to tools that do the job well regarding service scanning and privilege escalation for windows and linux.

A project I started with ambition but abandoned.
The idea was to create a parser of known tools xml output and create a good report.

In the aim to create a basic scan of a target.
Autorecon beat me to it: https://github.com/Tib3rius/AutoRecon.
