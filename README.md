# Pentest Scripts

## MacOS
A script that is good to teach how a stack based overflow is done on a network appliction running on a 32-bit windows operating system.
Follow the steps and comment out as you go.

## Crackers
Made a wordlist generator depending on the type of field you're trying to brute force.

## DNS
DNS lookup and reverse lookup returned nicely using the _host_ tool.

## Enumeration
A reference to tools that do the job well regarding service scanning and privilege escalation for windows and linux.

## MacOS
This contains some tools inspired by Offensive Security. All tools are installed through the homebrew package
manager (https://brew.sh/).

## Report
A project I started with ambition but abandoned.
The idea was to create a parser of known tools xml output and create a good report.

## Scanner
In the aim to create a basic scan of a target.
Autorecon beat me to it: https://github.com/Tib3rius/AutoRecon.

## Wordlists
Usefull lists that I keep as a backup on my repo.
